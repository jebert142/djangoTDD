# djangoTDD
Guided project for learning Test-Driven Development (using Selenium + GeckoDriver) in Django


Note regarding how to run this project:

  I've ended up pushing the entire virtual environment folder that was created along with the environment I had setup on my windows PC. To recreate a venv 
  on your machine, start a virtual env and then install Django, Selenium and GeckoDriver (GeckoDriver is specific for running tests on Firefox, other drivers
  are available for other browsers. Then, run the server whilst under the 'hashthat' directory.
  
  To run tests in Django, you can use 'python manage.py test' in the terminal/command prompt with your virtual environment running.
