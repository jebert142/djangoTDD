# djangoTDD
Guided project for learning Test-Driven Development (using Selenium + GeckoDriver) in Django


Note regarding how to run this project:

  I've ended up pushing the entire virtual environment folder that was created along with the environment I had setup on my windows PC. If you fork this repo, remove
  that whole venv directory and recreate your own. When you start a virtual env, ensure you install Django, Selenium and GeckoDriver. GeckoDriver is specific for 
  running tests on Firefox, which is what I used, but other drivers are available for other browsers. Then, run the server whilst under the 'hashthat' directory.
  
  To run tests in Django, you can use 'python manage.py test' in the terminal/command prompt with your virtual environment running.
